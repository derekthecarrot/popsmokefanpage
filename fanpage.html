        <h3>Pop Smoke Biography</h3>

            <p>Known for his breakout single "Welcome to the Party," Brooklyn's Pop Smoke combined gravelly vocals with erratic production to become the face of Brooklyn's rising drill scene.
                 Within just a year of his debut, he made a rapid rise in the mainstream, landing in the Top Ten with sophomore mixtape Meet the Woo, Vol. 2. 
                 Tragically, soon after achieving this chart peak, he was gunned down on February 19, 2020.</p>
